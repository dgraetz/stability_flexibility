This project is interested in conducting a multilevel test of stability-flexibility. We are interested in: (1) experimental-level effects, (2) within-subject effects, and (3) individual-difference effects. 

- **Experimental level:** Here we test whether experimental manipulations of previous and current trial control demands interact with the switch contrast in a manner that is consistent with a flexibility/stability tradeoff model. 

- **Within-subject level:** Here we test whether trial-by-trial RT auto-correlations in combination with considering the experimental effects express a flexibility/stability tradeoff.  

- **Individual differences level:** Here we test whether individual differences in measures of “stability/efficiency” and in measures of flexibility are consistent with the tradeoff model.
