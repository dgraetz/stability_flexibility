This project is interested in conducting a multilevel test of stability-flexibility. We are interested in: (1) experimental-level effects, (2) within-subject effects, and (3) individual-difference effects. The outcomes of these analyses will guide how we proceed with the individual differences level analyses. We begin by specifying our hypotheses, task design, and analytic approach for the experimental-level effects.   

- **Experimental level:** Here we test whether experimental manipulations of previous and current trial control demands interact with the switch contrast in a manner that is consistent with a flexibility/stability tradeoff model. 

- **Within-subject level:** Here we test whether trial-by-trial RT auto-correlations in combination with considering the experimental effects express a flexibility/stability tradeoff.  

- **Individual differences level:** Here we test whether individual differences in measures of “stability/efficiency” and in measures of flexibility are consistent with the tradeoff model.
